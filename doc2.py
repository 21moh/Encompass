# Send a POST request to the login URL with the payload
response = session.post(LOGIN_URL, data=login_payload)

# Check if login was successful by inspecting response or by looking for
# certain elements on the page that indicate a successful login
# (This step depends on the website's response and structure)

# Now you can make further authenticated requests; for example:
protected_page = 'https://www.example.com/protected_page'
response = session.get(protected_page)

# Use BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')

# Now you can navigate the parsed HTML tree with Beautiful Soup
# For example, find a tag with id='content'
content = soup.find(id='content')
print(content.get_text())

# Remember to close the session when done
session.close()
